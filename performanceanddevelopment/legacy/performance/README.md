The performance folder contains various utilities for measuring the performance of the
workspace or parts thereof.

Note that as of 2022/3/3 all the code is very old and has been updated numereous times to
simply make it compile without verifying that it still serves its intended purpose.

The code in these folders may be useful as a reference for constructing new performance tests but
may not work correctly as is.

The code is also generally quick and dirty and assumes a high degree of familiarity with workspace
operations and architecture - it's intended for users with a fairly high amount of experience
with the workspace.
