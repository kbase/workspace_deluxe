/*

The Workspace Service (WSS) is primarily a language independent remote storage
and retrieval system for KBase typed objects (TO) defined with the KBase
Interface Description Language (KIDL). It has the following primary features:
- Immutable storage of TOs with
	- user defined metadata 
	- data provenance
- Versioning of TOs
- Referencing from TO to TO
- Typechecking of all saved objects against a KIDL specification
- Collecting typed objects into a workspace
- Sharing workspaces with specific KBase users or the world
- Freezing and publishing workspaces
